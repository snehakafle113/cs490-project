- Worked with Anthony, Sneha, Bruno, and John to determine which form of auth we could use
- Anthony helped bring up reasons we could use firebase to start with
- looked into firebase with security team

## Sprint 2
- Began working with API to figure out what we need authenticated on the site
- Discussed benefits of manual login/tokens vs google login
- spent time researching how to create manual tokens for site due to believing them necessary

## Sprint 3
- Confirmed with professor that due to functions of Firebase, we do not need to create certain tokens manually
- Worked momentarily with API team, trying to understand what they needed from google to see if we needed to find separate authentication for anything

## Sprint 4
- created test logins to ensure firebase was working properly
- assisted with testing other functions on site
- spent time speaking with Bruno and Sneha to make sure we were on track and see what else might be needed
