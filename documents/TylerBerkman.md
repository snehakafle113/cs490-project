#Tyler Berkman UI Team 1

10/25:  Created this file

11/29:  Finally had the opportunity to start something of substance. Created ProfilePage.js and linked it back to home through the button already created.
        Started the basic formatting and the form for changing passwords.
        Made a small edit to index.css to fix formatting on the Profile Page but not ruin the rest of the project
        ^^
        This is for the branch "TylerBerkman/Profile" which ended up never being merged to main due to confusion over what I was meant to be working on. (Started this when I wasn't aware someone else was already constructing the profile)

12/8:   Started to create the TaskView for homePage.js Currently created a basic component, along with mounting the already made TasksCell component to this component.
        Still need to create the newTask/editTask drawer, as well as mount the Appointment list thats still in development as far as I'm aware
