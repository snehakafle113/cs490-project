#Tyler Berkman UI Team 1

10/25: Created this file

11/29: Finally had the opportunity to start something of substance. Created ProfilePage.js and linked it back to home through the button already created. Started the basic formatting and the form for changing passwords. Made a small edit to index.css to fix formatting on the Profile Page but not ruin the rest of the project
^^
Added this from branch "TylerBerkman/Profile" as my work on that was unfinished and was never merged (Miscommunication over who was doing what, eventually got moved to a different task)

12/8: Created basic component TaskView to mount task list and appointment list onto.
